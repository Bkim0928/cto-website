<h4>1. Address these special situations first:</h4>

<ul>
<li>
    If you are in a GSA office, connect your computer to a docking station while watching the video, instead of using wireless ("wifi").</li>
<li>
    If you are using a Mac, connect to a Horizon desktop (VDI), and then follow the instructions for Horizon in step 2. (If you need information about using Horizon on Mac, read this InSite page: <A HREF="https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/category/536278">Horizon VDI on a Mac</A>)</li>

</ul>
